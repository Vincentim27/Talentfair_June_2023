## **Project Description**

I made a dashboard to see a radar chart from Gender, Married status, Dependents, and Education column. I show Total Order information too with count order and Loan Amount Term Average to see how long they took the loan. 


## **Conclusion**
---
* The total orders that occurred in the data train were 553 orders
* Loan amount average of 341.66
* Married status has an average income greater than those who are not married
* Gender men have greater income than women
* Dependents 3+ have greater income than other categories
* Education in the graduate category has a greater income than those who have not graduated.
